## Build a snapshot of your money

Understanding what comes in, what goes out, and what you already owe is the foundation for every later move.
List your monthly take-home income, fixed expenses, and minimum debt payments so you know the baseline every plan
needs to cover.

<Callout title="Why this matters">
  Cash flow awareness keeps you from guessing whether a new goal is affordable. Once you know the numbers, you
  can direct dollars to the highest-impact tasks instead of reacting to surprises.

### Track essentials before fine-tuning

Keep things simple at the start. Use a spreadsheet, notebook, or budgeting app to categorize the essentials—housing,
transportation, groceries, insurance—before worrying about granular categories. The goal is momentum, not perfection.

<RuleOfThumb title="Three categories is enough when you start">
  Begin with **needs**, **wants**, and **future you**. If the math balances and you can cover future-you goals like
  savings or debt payoff, you are on the right track. Add detail only when it helps you make better decisions.
</RuleOfThumb>

## Stabilize your foundation

Once you know your baseline, make sure the fundamentals are covered automatically.

### Automate your non-negotiables

Schedule bill payments and automate transfers to savings the same day you get paid. Automation prevents missed
payments and frees attention for bigger strategic choices.

<Callout variant="success" title="Quick win">
  Re-route $50 each paycheck to a dedicated savings account. Label it "emergency buffer" so you remember its job
  and resist the temptation to dip into it for day-to-day spending.
