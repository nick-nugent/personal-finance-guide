## Start with goals and time horizons

Match each investing goal with the time frame when you will need the money. Short-term goals (less than three years)
belong in cash-like accounts, while longer goals can weather market swings and benefit from diversified stock and bond
exposure.

<Callout variant="info" title="Retirement is your default long-term goal">
  Most people invest primarily to fund retirement. Employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s and individual retirement
  accounts provide tax advantages that reward consistent contributions, even when the amounts are modest.

### Know your account order

Maximize employer matches first, then consider Roth or traditional IRAs, and finally taxable brokerage accounts once
tax-advantaged space is full. This sequencing helps you capture incentives without overcomplicating your plan.

<RuleOfThumb title="15% of gross income is a solid long-term target">
  If a full 15% is not realistic yet, contribute what you can now and increase the amount with every raise or bonus.
  Consistency matters more than one-time windfalls.
</RuleOfThumb>

## Keep costs low and stay diversified

Favor broad-market index funds or target-date funds that automatically rebalance to match your timeline. Avoid
speculation or frequent trading—time in the market beats timing the market.

### Automate and review annually

Set up automatic contributions and revisit your allocation once per year to confirm it still matches your goals and
timeline. Small adjustments over time compound into meaningful progress.

<Callout variant="success" title="Stick to the policy">
  Write down the rules for how you invest—contribution amounts, the funds you use, and when you rebalance. Refer back
  to the written plan whenever market news tempts you to overreact.
