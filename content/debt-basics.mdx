## Prioritize by interest rate and urgency

List every debt with the balance, minimum payment, and interest rate. Focus extra payments on the account with the
highest interest rate while paying minimums on the rest. This approach, often called the **avalanche**, minimizes the
total interest you pay.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Stay current on every account">
  Late payments damage your credit and trigger fees. Even when cash is tight, make the minimum payment on time to keep
  accounts in good standing while you attack the most expensive balance.
</Callout>

### Understand the trade-offs

If you need motivation to stay engaged, the snowball method—paying off the smallest balance first—can provide quicker
wins. Just make sure you switch to the highest interest balances once momentum kicks in so you still reduce overall
interest costs.

<RuleOfThumb title="Keep debt payments under 36% of gross income">
  Lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio when evaluating new credit. Staying below 36% (including housing payments)
  leaves room for future goals and keeps your budget flexible.
</RuleOfThumb>

## Prevent the balance from creeping back

Build a buffer to handle irregular expenses so you do not rely on credit cards when something unexpected happens.

### Negotiate when it helps

Call lenders to request lower rates or explore hardship programs if you are struggling. Refinancing or consolidating may
help, but only if you lock in a lower rate and avoid extending the term so far that you pay more interest overall.

<Callout variant="success" title="Keep future you in the plan">
  While paying down debt, direct a sliver of each paycheck to savings. Even $20 builds the habit and gives you a cushion
  so the next emergency does not undo your progress.
